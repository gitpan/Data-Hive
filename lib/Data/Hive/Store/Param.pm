=head1 NAME

Data::Hive::Store::Param - CGI::param-like store for Data::Hive

=head1 VERSION

version 1.012

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This hive store will soon be overhauled.

Basically, it expects to access a hive in an object with CGI's C<param> method,
or the numerous other things with that interface.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  # use default method name 'param'
  my $store = Data::Hive::Store::Param->new($obj);

  # use different method name 'info'
  my $store = Data::Hive::Store::Param->new($obj, { method => 'info' });

  # escape certain characters in keys
  my $store = Data::Hive::Store::Param->new($obj, { escape => './!' });

Return a new Param store.

Several interesting arguments can be passed in a hashref after the first
(mandatory) object argument.

=over 4

=item method

Use a different method name on the object (default is 'param').

This method should have the "usual" behavior for a C<param> method:

=over 4

=item *

calling C<< $obj->param >> with no arguments returns all param names

=item *

calling C<< $obj->param($name) >> returns the value for that name

=item *

calling C<< $obj->param($name, $value) >> sets the value for the name

=back

The Param store does not check the types of values, but for interoperation with
other stores, sticking to simple scalars is a good idea.

=item path_packer

This is an object providing the L<Data::Hive::PathPacker> interface.  It will
convert a string to a path (arrayref) or the reverse.  It defaults to a
L<Data::Hive::PathPacker::Strict>.

=item exists

This is a coderef used to check whether a given parameter name exists.  It will
be called as a method on the Data::Hive::Store::Param object with the path name
as its argument.

The default behavior gets a list of all parameters and checks whether the given
name appears in it.

=item delete

This is a coderef used to delete the value for a path from the hive.  It will
be called as a method on the Data::Hive::Store::Param object with the path name
as its argument.

The default behavior is to call the C<delete> method on the object providing
the C<param> method.
